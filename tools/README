	output_grafic2_dmm.cc
	---------------------

	Simple modification to the plugins/output_grafic2.cc in music
	so that CDM overdensity is now written out to ic_deltac
	(analogue to ic_deltab). To use, just copy to the plugins/
	directory in music, and select output plugin to be
	'grafic2_dmm'.


	ic_slice.py
	-----------

	Plots a slice of the biased and unbiased ICs
	side-by-side. Works if the biased ics are still in the
	level/ics_ramses_vbc/ directory.


	ic_anim.py
	----------

	Creates a slice animation of the x-y plane, stepping through
	the z-plane.


	constant_vbc.py
	---------------

	Imposes a constant v_bc on the initial conditions files for a
	specified level and magnitude of the v_bc.
