# drft

drft is a package to modify
[RAMSES](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses) (Teyssier 2002)
initial conditions (ICs) made by
[MUSIC](https://bitbucket.org/ohahn/music/src) (Hahn & Abel 2011) to
include the effects of relative baryon-dark matter velocities
(Tseliakhovich & Hirata 2010) from recombination to the starting time
of your simulation. It contains routines for solving the evolution
equations (`py_vbc`), which is essentially a Python reproduction of
`vbc_transfer` in CICsASS (O'Leary & McQuinn 2012). drft was
itself based on routines in
[seren3](https://github.com/sully90/seren3) written by David Sullivan.


### How to use

The basic steps for running drft are:

1. Compute transfer functions that have separate amplitudes for baryon
and dark matter velocities (e.g. using
[CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB/), Lewis 2000)

2. Use these transfer functions to generate cubic ICs using [MUSIC](https://bitbucket.org/ohahn/music/src)
(this can be enforced by setting `force_equal_extent=yes` in the
[MUSIC](https://bitbucket.org/ohahn/music/src) configuration file)

3. Calculate the v_bc field (this can be done using `yt_ic_vbc.py`,
which uses [yt](https://github.com/yt-project/yt), Turk et al. 2011)

4. Run `bias_ics.py` (see `work_ics.sh.example` for an example script)

Cosmological parameters for `py_vbc` can be set using a `.ini` file,
see `py_vbc/planck2018_params.ini` for an example. If you do want to
change parameters, you will need to:

1. Change `config_fname` in `py_vbc/constants.py` to the new
configuration filename

2. Regenerate transfer functions at z=1003, 1000, 997 and 200 (for the
setup described in the paper) and place them in `py_vbc/tfs/`

3. Regenerate a
[RECFAST](https://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/recfast.html)
(Seager et al. 1999) output and place it in `py_vbc/recfast/`
